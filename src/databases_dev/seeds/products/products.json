This includes options like 8K at 60fps, 4K at 120fps, but also manages up to 10k, to provide the upper end of high resolution gaming.ASUS engineered the ROG Strix GeForce RTX 3070 Ti to house the Ampere technology and its needs. ASUS puts an improved rotation scheme for a group of central and auxiliary axial tech fans to task, just above a heatsink designed to handle even the most demanding thermal loads. Aura Sync RGB lighting on the shroud and backplate is customizable to sync with other ASUS products, creating an all encompassing gaming setup that can take lighting cues from music, temperature, or with your hands on input. The RTX 3070 Ti gives you far superior performance to the previous generation’s top of the line GPUs, but at a much lower price. So why wait to bring your rig to the latest generation of gaming?","category":"Graphics Cards & Accessories","quantity":6,"specs":[{"name":"SKU","value":"283184"},{"name":"Mfr Part#","value":"STXRTX3070TIO8G"},{"name":"UPC","value":"195553243087"},{"name":"Form Factor","value":"Full Height"},{"name":"GPU Manufacturer","value":"NVIDIA"},{"name":"Number of GPUs","value":"1"},{"name":"GPU Chipset","value":"GeForce RTX 3070 Ti"},{"name":"Overclocked","value":"Yes"},{"name":"Boost Core Clock Speed","value":"1875MHz"},{"name":"CUDA Processors","value":"6144"},{"name":"PCIe Bandwidth","value":"PCIe 4.0 x16"},{"name":"Max Monitors Supported","value":"4"},{"name":"Video Memory","value":"8 GB"},{"name":"Memory Type","value":"GDDR6X"},{"name":"Memory Bus","value":"256-bit"},{"name":"Led Color","value":"RGB Illuminated"},{"name":"Color","value":"Black"},{"name":"VR Ready","value":"Yes"},{"name":"OpenGL Support","value":"OpenGL 4.6"},{"name":"DirectX Support","value":"DirectX 12"},{"name":"PCB Color","value":"Black"},{"name":"HDCP Support","value":"HDCP 2.3"},{"name":"3D Ready","value":"Yes"},{"name":"Cooling","value":"Fan"},{"name":"HDMI","value":"2 x HDMI 2.1"},{"name":"DisplayPort","value":"3 x DisplayPort 1.4a"},{"name":"Slot Width","value":"Triple Slot"},{"name":"Interface","value":"PCIe 4.0"},{"name":"Power Connector","value":"3 x 8-pin"},{"name":"Recommended Power Supply","value":"750 Watts"},{"name":"Height","value":"5.51 in.
